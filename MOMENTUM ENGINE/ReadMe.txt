Open up the Release Folder and copy athe two files in it into "C:\WINDOWS\System\".
 I don't know if you need the .exp and .lib files so you better put them in too just incase.

Now if you want to run the Demo, you have to click "Project > References" ( on the menu bar).
The engine is called "MOMENTUM ENGINE" Exactly like that. Look for it in the list and if it is there, check the box next to it.
If it is not there, click Browse and look for the engine in the System folder.

Now you can run the demo.

If you want to use the engine in your own projects, you just go through the same process of referencing it.
If you are familiar with directx, then this will come automatically because it's the same process except this time you MIGHT  have to browse for it but you will
probably have to do that in the Demo at least.
